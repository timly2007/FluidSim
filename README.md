# FluidSim
Interactive Fluid Simulator With Drawable Objects (Particle-Based and 2-Dimensional)

This particle-based fluid simulation helps users grasp a basic understanding of fluid flow around an object drawn on the screen. Variables may be adjusted to increase/decrease the amount of particles used. The two main principles behind this simulation is a modified version of Coulomb's law and cohesion.
